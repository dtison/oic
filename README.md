OIC - Optimized Image Compression
=================================

Image Compression Library I developed in 1990.

It uses a lossy DCT algorithm and was up and running before the JPEG 
specification (which also uses DCT based compression) was finalized.

Many of the functions were originally written in C, but I converted
them to x86 assembly to maximize performance.

If you are wondering why the odd filenames - any code on MSDOS / PC was
done that way in 1990.  Everything was on a  MSDOS 8.3 naming convention. 
(So the extensions are capitalized on case-sensitive filesystems)
